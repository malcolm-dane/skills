This isn't finished yet. Today is 9/17. I plan to finish up the last few files. I have had to work on this in broken 20 minute intervals.
I apologize for the delay. Coding with a toddler interuppting me every 10 minutes is hard. Also having issues with git CLI.
Not sure why it is listing the contributor as LemonIceStuff as the user unless it's the token name? Using ubutu subsystem on linux but the newer one.


***Update***
I am having tons of bugs in my build env since I bought a new computer a few months ago and have only been doing jetpack compose so some of the bugs are
from using the beta android studio specific to jetpack compose. I really wanted to go above and beyond and show off and literally publish this library on maven but I just don't have the time. The last time I made a mutliplat lib using Kotlin it was a hassle testing and tweaking the buildscript and I just don't have time for that.

**How to use**
If I get time this evening 9/19, I plan to bundle this in a jar file using the kotlin CLI. That should work, atleast it has in the past. I also plan to either quickly write a simple app that shows how to use it our just use psuedocode, again depends on time.

**Note**
I haven't tested this yet, since I was told I didn't need to test. If this was going to be used in a wide release I would have extensively tested it.

**ToDo**
I hate in code comments but plan to add them, not sure how verbose you want it. In the past for documentation I prefer making a javadoc html for each class and package detailing how to use each function and types etc, kind of like the documentation for Kotlin on Android.

1.Add comments.

2. Actually build this as a lib.

3. Add sample app or psuedocode


I apologize for the delay in completing this. This has been a very busy week, probably the worst week to have to do something like this for me. Not that the coding is hard, but because I want to make sure it looks good. I've only been able to work on this for about a hour so far. I had planned to work on some type of test last weekend, figuring I would get a skills type test after the interview, so my wife and son had plans to give me an afternoon to myself. It's just been a busy week, so thanks for understanding that I couldn't just drop everything to do this.



**Finishe**
I was trying to go the extra mile and make a library AAF that was signed and able to be added as a dependency but I keep having build issues. I could figure it out but I just want to submit this to you. In the past I was able to use a command line script that could build jars and aafs from a source folder but I can't install it on this new computer for some reasons. I tend to like Ubuntu or Debian but right now I am using the subsystem on linux and none of the command line tools seem to work. If you want to test my knowledge on building a Kotlin multiplat lib I would be happy to discuss how I have used it in the past, for instance I took a master Android Developer UDemy course earlier this winter and building a multiplat Kotlin lib was one of the projects. I know you guys want me to submit this as soon as possible so I am just going to save changes and commit it. I have only worked on this for about 4 hours and most of that time was trying to my system set up right. I will be happy to answer questions, and I can also provide notable references who can affirm that I am a good software developer. Sorry again for the delay.
